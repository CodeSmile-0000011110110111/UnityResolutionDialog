# UnityResolutionDialog
Replacement for Unity's built-in resolution dialog (aka Screen Selector) that was removed in Unity 2019.3. Works both up front (simply make it the first scene) and as a popup dialog (default key: ESC). Intended for development / testing purposes but can also be used in production.
